# Project: Etch-a-sketch

### Description

A simple pixel art app built with vanilla **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** as part of [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

You can use the app to **create your own pixel art** using simple tools.

The **color swatch** lets you pick any color you want to draw with using the pen tool, or to fill in the background.

You can activate **rainbow mode** by clicking on the **Unicorn button** and draw using the six rainbow colors - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo.

The **shader/lightener tool** gradually darkens/lightens only the pixels of the drawing itself (but not the background) until they are completely black/white.

If you make a mistake you can easily fix it using either the **eraser tool** or the **undo button**, which reverses the color fill one pixel at a time. And the **color grabber** is your best friend to keep things consistent while working on the details.

The app is **responsive** and can be used on small screens/mobile devices.

**Live preview:** [here](https://antikun.github.io/Etch-a-sketch/).

### Aims
Apply everything I've learned so far to make a fully functional and responsive pixel art app.

### Results

* Learned how to set up click and drag (mousedown & mouseover) event listeners.
* Got more practice using array methods and generally implementing object literals and arrays in my code.
* Got practice with the **mobile-first** design approach.
* Got better(quicker) at **refactoring** the code.

### Things to improve in the future
* Add color fill (bucket tool) feature and perhaps an export image/download button.
* Make the touchmove listener for touch devices actually work...
